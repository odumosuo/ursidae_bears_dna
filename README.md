# Machine learning models to analyze Ursidae (Bears) DNA 

## Description
This project explores the distribution and species richness of Ursidae. It uses supervised machine learning to develop a classifier that could identify if a species is in the Ursidae family and applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to group the species within the Ursidae family. We also performed both hierarchical clustering by alignment and hierarchical clustering by sequence features. To visualize the results, we employed both Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-
Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). We used the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase
I (COI) for our analyses, as it has been shown to be effective in the global bio identification system for
animals
